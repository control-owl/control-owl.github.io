# Introduction

Since the beginning of cryptocurrency, I’ve tried many different clients and wallet applications to generate crypto keys. However, none of them supported **all** the coins I owned, and over the years, I’ve seen numerous apps and wallets get hacked or become compromised in some way. I experimented with every wallet that existed. Eventually, I settled on [IanColeman][iancoleman]'s website because it supported a **lot** of coins. Then I read that the website might be infected with malicious code, potentially compromising the randomness and **security** of my keys. I’ve always been paranoid about my keys. I even used [Qubes OS][qubes-os] for over a year and relied on offline versions of key generators. But no solution felt sufficient, and in the end, I was hacked before I even noticed—my keys were gone.

# So, who am I

## Old days

I was born in a country that no longer exists. Back then, there were no smartphones, and payphones were still in use. People gathered outside to exchange stories. Like all idyllic times, mine ended with a war. It happened when I was 4, and it triggered something inside me to become a **survivalist**. Maybe that’s why I never give up and manage to achieve what I want when I truly set my mind to it. After the war, my father bought us a PC. We started with **MS-DOS**, then **Win-NT**, and later **Win-95**. Thanks to my dad and his curiosity about PCs, I am the man I am today. He was a hardware expert, while I became the software guy. We didn’t have the internet back then—no one on my street did. All we had were floppy drives, hundreds of them. I owned every color; I had so many. I remember those days clearly, the days before CDs arrived in stores. With my first CDs, I got a copy of [Visual Basic 6][visual-basic].

## Developing logical thinking

Say what you want, but programmers think differently from others. They’re smart, but in a unique way. In life, you can give up, you can die, you can become paralyzed or mentally ill, or you can just stop caring. Now think hard: how would you program that? I broke my brain a few times, really broke it, for weeks, trying to understand **multi-dimensional arrays**. But now I know workarounds, even in **Bash**. Back then, I didn’t speak English. I learned it by pressing **F1** in Visual Basic and trying to replicate the code in my own app. That was my game. It’s when I isolated myself, retreating to the basement to learn more.


## Legacy apps

Rewind one or two summers, and I could program anything. I had my own audio player—can you imagine that? A program that played **WAV** files. Just play and pause. Then shuffle, then themes, then a database, then a video module, then a visualizer, then an internet browser, and on and on. I never stopped. Before 2000 came, I was a **PC freak**. I created apps for my father’s friends and their customers. I could do **SQL** when people didn’t even know what the PC acronym stood for. Has anyone used [Illumination Software Creator][illumination]? I know it’s not a programming language, but sorting logic and wires was my strength. One of my apps, "My Astronomy," was really appreciated in high school. I think my father saw potential in me then.


## Private schools

When you think of private schools, you might imagine jets, fancy cars, and glamour, but no, my experience was chaos. I had a **Computer Programmer** class at one school for three hours a day, then raced across town with my mom in her car, to another school where I studied as an **Electrical Engineer**. In the evenings, I returned to the first school for **Web Design** in HTML. The Visual Basic course? I only took it for the diploma since I already knew everything. Since **VB** was easy, **HTML** and **CSS** were too. The first year was tough, just managing the schedule. In my second year, I had morning classes at my regular school, so I could only attend private school in the evening for one class: **Graphical Design**. Photoshop and AutoCAD, raster and vector, that was simple. My third year, I rested. In my fourth, I took a **PHP Programmer** class just to learn something new.

## After school

I never went to college. I still don’t think they could teach me anything new, just textbook nonsense. I was already writing my own viruses. My first worm **censored** was my biggest secret success. And they wanted to teach me how to turn on a PC? How many bits are in a 56k modem connection? **IP subnets**? Too late—I already knew it all. For some, school is overrated. I joined the military instead. Hi-ha, motherfather. Just don’t give me a rifle anymore. Today, I’d think differently, but back then, I had to go. I learned something: no matter how badly you want to play **Warcraft 3** on a military base, don’t break into any offices. Chill out like everyone else. Don’t throw parties for your brigade every Saturday and expect no one to snitch. One hop, skip, and I was out.

## The man

A fuck, now I have to work. At 18, I had my own apartment. I was the first among us to get a job, an **apartment**, and a lady in such a short time. Oh man, money and **success**—I had none of it. Oh, how I loved to party so much. I was even a DJ for some time, playing **Dark Psy** music at festivals and parties. I met my future wife there. By day, I worked as an IT admin in a big company, and at night, I played from Friday until the last people stayed at the afterparty. I was such a **Psychonaut**. I feel so old now, remembering those days, but those were my days. Ego trips, parties, loud music, sex, and rock and roll. At one point, I started a humanitarian organization, **Indigo Children**, to help spread our love to everyone. Those times brought me happiness.

# Digital time

For me, this started when I began to mine crypto. **Bitcoin** was the one. I was obsessed with this Satoshi Nakamoto and his brainchild. My real interest kicked off around **2014/2015** when I started buying machines for mining. I solved my first BTC block in 2015, and the next year, BTC hit **$1000**, and I sold everything. I went to Amsterdam because there was a Bitcoin ATM. I sold 25 Bitcoins (secretly, I still cry like a child because of it). With my girlfriend, we booked a nice house for 30 days on **AirBNB**. We had the best vacation ever. Money and Shrooms.


## Altcoins

They brought chaos, at least for me. They’re like those stupid named Linux distros nobody uses. Runtu? Why not? Why not Ubuntu with a brown theme? Then it could be Browntu. **Shitcoins**. They cost me my life, my time, and my strength. Oh, I wish they never existed. When you imagine 100 shitcoins, I had them all. Imagine the next 100 shitcoins—yes, I had those too. Scroll down to the 500th coin on **CoinMarketCap**, and I had them all.
