# The hunt

I spoke few times about mesuring my effort. Let's try to capture my moment.

## The start

I am starting now, 2025-06-19 at 16:16 to try to produce executable on a GitHub.

...

Few minutes later, and I got stuck by cross-platform problems. Next step, try to put it in a container.
And this is the moment when you get **300 build errors**. All linked to static libraries.

Why did I decided to do first **x86_64-unknown-linux-musl** and then rest?

Now think pause...

...

It is 2 days after. Still no progress. Waisted whole Saturday to resolve this.

...

Now it is 5 days after, I think I have it. Yesterday I was wake late and was almost there but when I resolve 1 problem, 2 more pops out.
