# Introduction

Since the beginning of cryptocurrency, I’ve tried many different clients and wallet applications to generate crypto keys. However, none of them supported **all** the coins I had, and over the years, I’ve seen many apps and wallets get hacked or some part of them becomes compromised. I tried all of the wallets which existed. At the end I stuck only on [IanColeman][iancoleman]'s website, since it could support lot of coins. Then I reed that website is maybe infected with a malicious code, compromising the randomness and security of my keys. I was always paranoid when it comes to my keys. I even ended up using [Qubes OS][qubesos] more then a year and offline versions of key generators. But no solution was enough for me since at the end I was hacked before I even noticed and my keys went away.

# So, who am I

I was born in a country which does not exists any more. Back then when there were no smartphones, when payphones were still in use.








I hate hacking and stealing crypto — it's a problem that has plagued the industry from the start! This motivated me to create **QR2M** — a secure, open-source app that can generate cryptographic keys for a vast number of cryptocurrencies, even more securely than many of the available solutions.

One key feature of **QR2M** is the use of **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**, a level of entropy generation that isn’t yet widely used. Most crypto apps rely on traditional RNG or predictable methods that can be compromised, but QRNG ensures that keys are generated in the most secure, random manner possible.

My goal is to give every crypto user on this planet the chance to generate secure keys and never have to worry about them being stolen. That’s why I support **254 coins** right now, with the aim to offer a truly comprehensive solution for anyone who wants to securely store their cryptocurrency.

In fact, even the most widely-known tools like the **iancoleman.io/bip39** website don’t support as many coins as **QR2M** does. I wanted to create a tool that goes beyond the limitations of current apps and provides the highest possible security to everyone, no matter which coin they are working with.

### Future Vision: QRNG Hardware Support

One of my long-term goals is to add support for **QRNG hardware devices** to further enhance the security of cryptographic key generation. Unfortunately, these devices are currently too expensive for me to purchase on my own. However, if anyone is interested in supporting the project financially to help me acquire a USB QRNG device, it would be greatly appreciated! With such a device, I could further enhance **QR2M's** security and provide even better key generation for users.

### Support the Project

If you’d like to help fund the purchase of a QRNG hardware device or support the development of **QR2M**, please consider donating. You can donate via the following platform:

Any contribution would help and be greatly appreciated in achieving the vision for this project!
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
